Kotlin
------
>Kotlin feature tests.

Kotlin
------
>Kotlin focuses strongly on **2** critical concepts:
1. nullability
2. throwing exceptions
>In the FP space, these practices are both foreign and unacceptable.

Arrow
-----
>Arrow is the purported **goto** FP library in the Kotlin space.
>In a limited manner, it mirrors the Typelevel Cats library.

Note
----
>Due to the constant flux of Arrow, ValidatedTest is broken at a critical point in the test.
