Kotlin
------
>Kotlin feature tests, to include:
1. Arrow
2. Hoplite
3. Ktor
4. Exposed
>and Kotlin:
1. Json
2. Testy

Design
------
>Kotlin strongly focuses on **2** concepts:
1. nullability
2. throwing exceptions
>In the FP space, both concepts are foreign.

Collections
-----------
>Kotlin collections are **not** Scala collections. They appear to mimic Java collections.

Arrow
-----
>Arrow is the **goto** FP library in the Kotlin space. In a limited way, it mirrors the
>Typelevel Cats library. Arrow is in constant flux, though, and should be used sparingly.
