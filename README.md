Kotlin
------
>Kotlin strongly focuses on **2** concepts:
1. nullability
2. throwing exceptions
>In the FP space, these concepts are both foreign and unacceptable.

Collections
-----------
>Simply stated, Kotlin collections are weak - and don't even rmotely measure up to Scala collections.
>Several Scala collection constructs don't even exist in Kotlin. This will shock **all** FP developers.

Arrow
-----
>Arrow is the purported **goto** FP library in the Kotlin space.
>In a very limited manner, it mirrors the Typelevel Cats library.
>Arrow is in constant flux, though. User beware!
